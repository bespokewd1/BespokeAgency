                        Web design focuses on the visual aspects of a website, including layout, colors, and typography. It’s about creating an engaging and user-friendly interface. Web development, on the other hand, involves building the functionality and features of the website, such as coding, database management, and integrating APIs to make the site operational.                    </p>

                        Web hosting is a service that allows your website to be accessible on the internet. It involves storing your website files on a server that is connected to the web. Hosting is essential because without it, your website cannot be viewed by users.                    </p>
