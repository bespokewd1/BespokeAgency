When setting up your business website, you might be torn between using a page builder or opting for custom code. Here's why custom code is often the superior choice.

**What Are Page Builders?**

Page builders like Wix, Squarespace, and WordPress’s Elementor let you create websites by dragging and dropping elements. While they simplify the process, they can be limiting and may not deliver the best performance.

**What Is Custom Code?**

Custom code involves building your website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s like having a tailor craft a suit just for you, instead of settling for a one-size-fits-all. This method offers unmatched control and flexibility.

#### **Why Choose Custom Code?**

1. **Unique Design and Branding:** Custom code ensures your website is truly unique to your business. Unlike page builders that rely on generic templates, custom code helps your site stand out and accurately represent your brand.
2. **Better Performance:**

o	**Faster Load Times:** Custom code is lightweight, leading to faster page loads. Page builders often add unnecessary code that can slow things down.

o	**Improved Search Rankings:** Google favors fast-loading sites. Custom-coded sites, free from page builder bloat, are more likely to rank higher.

o	**Mobile Optimization:** Custom code ensures your site performs well on mobile devices. Page builders can struggle with mobile responsiveness.

o	**Reduced HTTP Requests:** Custom code minimizes the number of requests needed to load your site, while page builders may add extra requests.

o	**Efficient Resource Use:** Custom-coded sites use server resources more effectively, potentially lowering hosting costs.

3. **More Flexibility:** Custom code allows you to add unique features and make precise adjustments. Page builders can be restrictive if you need something out of the ordinary.
4. **Enhanced Security:** Custom-coded sites are generally more secure. Page builders are common targets for hackers due to their widespread use and vulnerabilities.
5. **Better Support and Maintenance:** With custom code, you work directly with web developers who know your website inside and out. Page builders often involve slower, third-party support and extra costs for plugins. As a business owner, focusing on your strengths and letting a professional handle the technical side can save you time and headaches.

**Why DIY Websites May Not Be Worth the Hassle**

DIY platforms like Wix and WordPress may seem appealing, but they often fall short in terms of speed, security, and performance. Many business owners who start with these tools end up frustrated by their limitations and inefficiencies, wasting time and effort. Hidden fees and slow speeds can add to the disappointment.

**Studies reveal that over 60% of small business owners using DIY website builders are dissatisfied with their results and later seek out web agencies for a custom solution that better meets their needs.** A professionally built custom site offers superior quality and performance—akin to the difference between painting a house yourself and hiring a pro.

**What Does This Mean for Your Business?**

Choosing custom code means investing in a website perfectly tailored to your business. **It’s like having a site custom-fit to your needs—high-performing, secure, and flexible.** If you want a site that truly reflects your business and stands out, custom code is the way to go.
